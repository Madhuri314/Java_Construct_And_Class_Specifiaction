### Class, Objects and methods
• A <b>Class</b> can be considered as a blueprint using which you can create as many objects as you like.<br>
• <b>Objects</b> have state and behavior.<br>
• <b>Abstraction</b> is a process where you show only “relevant” data and “hide” unnecessary details of an object from the user.<br>
• <b>Encapsulation</b> simply means binding object state(fields) and behaviour (methods) together. If you are creating class, you are doing encapsulation.<br>
• <b>Association</b> establishes relationships between two Objects so as to enable Method Invocation.<br>
